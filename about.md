Hi again! I was born in New Delhi, India and currently am a sophomore at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. I've deeply enjoyed my 
programming ðŸŽ’ journey so far, and I'm excited to learn more to be able to use technology to tackle the critical issues affecting our generation which I care deeply about - climate change, income inequality, and human rights. 
I encourage you to check out some amazing work being done on these issues at the [Sunrise Movement](http://now.sh) and [Rose Caucus](http://now.sh).

In my free time, I'm a bedroom musician and love discovering indie music - check out my [Spotify](http://now.sh)! I'm also a huge
Manchester United fan and love reading texts on political and critical theory.

I appreciate everything from a bug report to just a casual, sweet hello - so feel free to get in touch.
