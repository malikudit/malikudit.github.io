Hi again! I'm a junior at Vanderbilt University, and will be a Data Scientist Intern at Facebook in summer 2022 in Seattle! I'm extremely interested in product analytics based data science, and have enjoyed an equally exciting journey learning software engineering. I hope to be able to use technology to tackle critical issues affecting our generation - climate change, income inequality, and human rights. 

In my free time, I'm a bedroom musician and also love discovering indie music - check out my some of my [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/k0vephjyyzuidcol84b7td26n)! 
Also a big fan of Manchester United.

I appreciate everything from a bug report to just a casual, sweet hello - so feel free to get in touch.
