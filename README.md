## Introduction

This is where my personal website and blog exist, built with a minimalist Jekyll theme called Klis√©, which you can find
<a href="https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.<br>
My website is live at <a href="https://malikudit.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malikudit.github.io</a>

## Installation
To use the original theme, run a local server first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise.git
cd jekyll-klise
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Navigate to `localhost:4000`, and you're ready to go.
