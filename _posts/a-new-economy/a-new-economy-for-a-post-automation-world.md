### Introduction ðŸ’»

We've been seeing rapid increases in the safety of autonomous vehicles over the past few years and their rapid rise in the
mainstream along with it, yet an unresolved issue remains the possible legal and financial implications with regard to how
the car insurance industry will adapt to these new changes. Liability, too, is an issue that will exist throughout all stages of
autonomous vehicle development. Volvo, for example, recently became one of the first companies to acknowledge these issues, and
stated that it will hold itself accountable in all cases of malfunctions/accidents involving one of their autonomous mode enabled
vehicles.


### The Problem

A seemingly logical solution could be to use "captive insurances", where companies start their own insurance subcompany. Captives could be more cost-effective in the long run, and offers a solution to the worry insurance companies today may have of becoming redundant due to low profits (this is quite unfounded - although the number of accidents continues to be at an all-time low, the cost per accident has risen rapidly). It's a reasonable guess that insurance costs will fluctuate only slightly and may decrease, and as accident occurences go down, profits may remain relatively the same.
