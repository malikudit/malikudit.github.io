### Introduction 

Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman’s Manufacturing Consent , on the surface, does not appear to be a work in philosophy but rather, in political analysis and social criticism. This is unsurprising; Chomsky’s background is primarily that of a linguist. However, over the past few 
decades, he has churned out numerous works on the philosophy of politics, ideology, and mass media. This analysis attempts to discuss two primary subjects:
a) attempts to analyze Chomsky’s views on the influence of mass media and the formation of a “culture industry''
b) subsequently compare the general philosophical differences in some positions held by Chomsky, Karl Marx, and Marxist scholars belonging to the Frankfurt School of thought.

In Manufacturing Consent , Chomsky talks about the political reality of mass media being manipulated and controlled by an elite corporatocracy, which helps it reinforce state policies
and influence public opinion. Chomsky primarily uses recent historical incidents as evidence to this, and in doing so reveals the well-calculated content of social media simply is meant to
reinforce the state’s ideology, while at the same time suppressing opposing strains of thought and opposition. This is very similar to the concerns many Frankfurt School thinkers, like
Horkheimer and Adorno, had in The Dialectic of Enlightenment - that the only purpose of all forms of art, entertainment, and popular culture is to serve the interests of the market, that is, to
generate profits for them and ensure the continuous obedience of the masses to this indoctrination.

“The mass media serve as a system for communicating messages and symbols to the general
populace. It is their function to amuse, entertain, and inform, and to inculcate individuals with the
values, beliefs, and codes of behavior that will integrate them into the institutional structures of
the larger society. In a world of concentrated wealth and major conflicts of class interest, to fulfil
this role requires systematic propaganda.”

Chomsky’s works, thus, can be viewed closely in comparison to the work of the Frankfurt School and of Karl Marx. Much like Marx’s idea of false consciousness , Manufacturing Consent talks
about how the defense of the state’s ideology through the use of mass media indoctrinates the masses into adopting positions in society which are detrimental to their own well being.
Although Chomsky has never identified as a Marxist, he does hold several views that Marxists hold in their criticism of capitalism and mass media and how they are broken and oppressive. As Marx is
quoted, “it is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social
existence that determines their consciousness. ”

### The Propaganda Model
Before analyzing these different strains of thought, I summarize Chomsky’s “propaganda model” below with the five primary claims it makes:
1. The first thing is to consider the ownership of mass media, which is either taxpayers (in public media) or shareholders/corporations (in private media.) This means that media is
prone to influence, and the effect which, for instance, a news story might have on approval ratings can influence whether the story gets covered and the spin it has.
2. Advertising influences media and vice-versa, as it is the primary form of revenue for corporations. The for-profit nature means that advertisers are unwilling to run ads critical of the corporations and individuals that own media companies, and likewise,
media companies will be unwilling to run negative stories about their primary sources of
revenue.
3. News which is more attractive is preferred over factual reporting, and PR positions (like the White House spokesperson) attempt to discourage investigative journalism in order
to “offer” access to stories and relationships, leading to news biased towards corporations and states due to more concentrated journalism about these areas too.
The media, thus is dependent on corporations and the state for its very existence and thus does not have the ability to criticize these structures freely.
4. The fourth component talks about “flak”, which refers to negative responses to a media
statement. Examples of these are inherently political in nature - legislation and testimonies in Congress, for example. The GCC (Global Climate Coalition), for example,
consisting of companies like Exxon and Ford, was made to attack the credibility of climate scientists and utilize the media in order to form fear about global warming
5. The final, and most explicit connection between mass media and politics according to Chomsky, lies in how the media defines and reports on “anti-ideologies” to define a
political ‘enemy.’ Manufacturing Consent was written in the 1980s and identified the media’s anti-communist sentiment in order to silence voices which were critical of
corporations and the government, and to instill fear (and therefore authority) and hatred
in the public to ideologies opposing the ideology of the state. As examples of this
version of censorship, he says that although individuals are often criticized, the wider
system (controlled by the state and sponsored by corporations) is often ignored.

### The dialectic of ideology and power
The propaganda model is key to understanding Chomsky’s core beliefs, and explaining his general claim that the effect of mass media today in the public sphere leads to societal control
and corporate authoritarianism, which aims at suppressing opposing ideologies. Evidently, as
we’re dealing with several seemingly disconnected but inherently political ideas, it’s important to identify an underlying dialectic in Chomsky’s work between ideology and power. This dialectic is
not explicit, as Chomsky claims to have never understood the concept of the dialectic. However, this relationship between ideology and power successfully explains Chomsky’s propaganda
model and vice-versa. Power and control (in the modern context, wielded by corporations and the state), control the ideology of the state and the way society functions. This shaping of
society and ideology, then, helps defend the power in the hands of those directing the ideology
much like the fifth point of Chomsky’s model where capitalism provides sustenance for
corporations and the state, which in turn promote a hardwired defense of the system in society
and suppress ideologies critical of it. Ideology and power are not accidental or isolated in their
relationship, but are interdependent and determined by each other - by itself, either one’s nature
is inexplicable (for instance, the indoubtably anti-communist rhetoric of the media during the
Cold War which supported the state’s position cannot be explained without considering this
relationship between ideology and power).

In this dialectic lies similarity in the thoughts of Adorno and Chomsky. It is important to
distinguish Chomksy’s dialectic from the traditional, Hegelian dialectic. Ideology and power are
interrelated with a negative dialectic as two elements that exhibit a clear failure to progress
towards sublation or synthesis; the self and the other, that is, ideology and power, simply
interact in society without resolving each other successfully and instead producing something
negative in society (in this case, an oppressive and fascist-enabling society). It
Adorno, and the Frankfurt School, were more focused on understanding what the effects of
mass media were on society in terms of promoting fascism, alienation, the erasure of the
individual into the mass, and so on. As opposed to that, Chomsky’s propaganda model is more
interested in understanding the behavior of mass media in terms of why it exists the way it does
today. Chomsky calls this model inevitable based on the structural organization of advanced
capitalist states like the US. The dialectic between ideology and power dictates the propaganda
model’s general relationship between the state and society, and is highly based on Marx’s idea
of the class struggle.

Marx’s “conflict theory” comes into play here, on how corporations maintain order in society by
virtue of their wealth and power (and not necessarily consensus.) The primary focus of those
with wealth and power is to hold on to it, as Chomsky says, and we see this today with six
corporations (GE, Viacom, Time Warner, CBS, Disney, and News-Corp) owning 90% of the media
Americans consume. The media, therefore, is influenced by the corporations’ desire to maintain
their control over wealth and thus the articles they produce - from the topic and content to the
advertisers they pick - are deliberately chosen in order to maintain their hegemony. It also helps
with a constant defense of capitalism which is undeniably the ideology of the American state
today. Chomsky’s propaganda model is therefore simply an elaborate explanation of how the
dialectic between ideology and power has manifested its negative consequences in our society
today.

### The Culture Industry & Manufactured Consent
Adorno (along with Horkheimer) in The Dialectic of Enlightenment coined the term “the culture
industry.” This is an example of Adorno’s use of the negative dialectic (with ‘culture’ and
‘industry’ being historically opposing terms) and an elaboration on the state of society where
different forms of media have simply become standardized tools which influence culture and
manipulate the masses into docility and submission to the capitalist state. They attribute this as
a tool and reason behind the rise of authoritarianism and fascism, and as a form of mass
hypnosis that fascists used to shape public opinion. The culture industry is also influenced by
the mode of production of these cultural commodities which are imbued with the capitalist
ideology.
An observation Adorno made was that the influence of the culture industry is oppressive
inherently even without imposed oppression - in other words, the influence of mass media is
constant and continuously manipulative even in non-fascist states.
“The beauty of the system, however, is that such dissent and inconvenient information are kept
within bounds and at the margins, so that while their presence shows that the system is not
monolithic, they are not large enough to interfere unduly with the domination of the official
agenda.”
This, in particular, is a dangerous thing because a seemingly democratic state like the US is also
imposing forms of authoritarian control over the masses through mass media and technology.
While material conditions remain the same and do not deteriorate for the average person, he will
continue to accept this control and surrender his personal freedom to enforce the state’s
demand of social conformity. This not only erodes the consciousness amongst the people
about the real power structure of society and their own exploitation, but also erodes the
possibility of criticism for the system. Additionally, the culture industry, much like Chomsky’s
criticism of mass consumerism, points towards the mass production of these cultural goods
which are packaged as media and entertainment. This mass production, intentionally
overwhelming, simply attempts to appease and influence the public towards being more
accepting of material goods and values as their perception of freedom and happiness, which
leads to potentially fascist issues. These phenomena have commodified the media into a single
culture which exists simply to ensure the maintenance of a mindless population powerless in
front of market interests and corporations which aim to serve and exploit the masses, while the
masses stay “desperate” for these cultural commodities and thus their own exploitation.
It is also a form of systemic repetition which aims at numbing the minds of the masses to erode
their ability to think critically about the system outside the sphere of influence of the culture
industry. “Film, radio, and magazines form a system. Each branch of culture is unanimous within
itself and all are unanimous together. Even the aesthetic manifestations of political opposites
proclaim the same inflexible rhythm.”
This leads to the formation of an ideological hegemony which renders even the simplest
possibility of alternatives to the current ideology of the state as impossible, and makes the
system seem so self-evident that the masses can be manipulated into giving up more and more
of their personal freedoms to defend it against their own interest, like in the case of fascist
Germany. By shifting focus away from the actual product to the “lifestyle” it creates and instead
of consumption, attempts to attract consumers by connecting the pleasure and social benefits
gained by the consumption of that product to happiness and personal freedom. This
overwhelming of our sensory perceptions not only controls us but also leads to a destruction of
the actual commodity (or art) as well, and along with the failures of capitalism it leads to the
growth of fascism. Modern Marxist philosopher Slavoj Zizek analyses this problem accurately:
“ The point is not that people possess distorted representations of reality, since in our
post-ideological society many people no longer tryst ideological truths, but rather, that even when
we keep an irony distance away from totalizing ideological representations, we still act according
to these representations.”

### Marx and Chomsky
In the modern world, Chomsky isn’t the first to connect the rather philosophical statement Marx
made with the real world’s relationship between ideology and power. In State and Revolution,
Vladimir Lenin stated that the bourgeoisie and the Czar and landowners had imposed a false
consciousness onto the Russian people. Today, Chomsky’s thoughts agree with the idea that
modern corporations, as they wield the largest amount of wealth and power today, are doing the
same to uphold the political and economic system of capital ownership by manipulating the
masses.
“If in fact humans are infinitely malleable, completely plastic beings, with no innate structures of
mind and no intrinsic needs of culture or social character, then they are fit subjects for the
‘shaping of behaviour’ by state authorities, the corporate manager, the technocrat, or central
committee.”
“The general population doesn’t know what’s happening, and it doesn’t even know that it doesn’t
know”
The Frankfurt school, too, holds similar views. Herbert Marcuse, for example, urged the need for
the masses to develop an understanding of class consciousness which was consistent with
their position in society in order to attend to their material needs; in other words, the need to
transform false consciousness into true consciousness. He quotes in One-Dimensional Man :
“Men must come to…find their way from false to true consciousness, from their immediate
interests to their real interest.”
Marcuse criticizes the high amount of social control exerted by the state today with the help of
technology and mass media - he further goes on to say that the authoritarian inescapability of
the current system has even successfully transformed this false consciousness into becoming
a reality. Large corporations and consumerism manipulate the masses by attempting to keep
them entertained and thus falsely happy, unaware of their exploitation by the ruling classes
while maintaining enough material luxury to keep the masses in a state of eternal ignorance
about class division.
An important idea to realize here is that corporations are not independent from the state in
terms of control over the state, and that corporations and the state are in control of each other
due to their interrelatedness, with mass media simply a tool to shape and maintain public
opinion about the current state of affairs. In How The World Works , Chomsky describes the
current hegemony of corporations and the government by insisting that it is only so because
they are the only two classes in society which have developed class consciousness, and much
like Marx, he believes it is imperative to help the general public develop class consciousness in
order to shift this power structure to be more oriented towards helping the masses materially.
Despite his criticisms of capitalist states, however, Chomsky does not identify as a Marxist and
differs significantly from the Frankfurt School on this. Although historically there have been little
to no interactions between Chomsky and any of the Frankfurt scholars (except Habermas), his
debate with Michel Foucault provides insight into his fundamental disagreement with Marx on
the idea of human nature. Chomsky, in his theory of universal grammar, develops the idea that
independent of human consciousness, perception and sensation, there exist some structural
rules which are innate to us; he expresses a belief in rationalism here and completely rejects
behaviorism.
As an example, Chomsky talks about a situation where when the possibility of speaking a
sentence is presented to a person, there are a large, nearly infinite, number of possible coherent
responses to construct a random sentence yet to understand this “infinite generative capacity”
there must be some innate and abstract understanding of grammar within that person. Although
Chomsky has expressed further beliefs in rationalism and that there must exist innate
structures with some a priori knowledge in human beings that have allowed all languages to
develop naturally with some universal properties in their grammar structures.
“ The speed and precision of vocabulary acquisition leaves no real alternative to the conclusion
that the child somehow has the concepts available before experience with language and is
basically learning labels for concepts that are already a part of his or her conceptual apparatus".
- (1988). Language and the problems of knowledge. MIT Press. p. 24.
Although both Marx and Chomsky would disagree here with empiricism’s proposition that
experience and sensory perception are the force behind logic, Marx is hardly a rationalist and
holds views quite different from Chomsky’s rationalism. Marx does not believe in any innate
quality that connects and relates all human beings by virtue of being present in each individual.
Instead, he argues that human nature is formed purely by its interaction with social structures in
his sixth these in Theses of Feuerbach :
“Feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man]. But the essence of man is
no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In reality, it is the ensemble of the social
relations.”
Instead, Marx believes in historical materialism, which directly contradicts the idea of any innate
human understanding and instead states that it is purely the social state of being of an
individual that is responsible for developing their consciousness. In many ways, this is empirical
in nature as Marx does not outright deny the role of reason in forming human consciousness,
nor does he attribute historical materialism purely to sensory experience as the historical source
of our knowledge.

### End Remarks
In this analysis, I the most famous work of Noam Chomsky, who is considered one of the greatest political and
philosophical minds of our generation. Chomsky’s social commentary is unequivocally
critical of today’s political capitalist system which is intertwined with the influence of
corporations on the state, and on mass media. Historical concerns that the Frankfurt School
(particularly, Adorno) and Marx had about the development on society and technology, and the
rise of fascism and oppression have mostly come true and Manufacturing Consent was a great,
example-ridden work elaborating on how these changes have adapted to modern ways to serve
the ultimate purpose of mass media which is to defend the ideology of the state, capitalism.
Despite being different thinkers holding diametrically opposite positions on many issues,
Adorno, Marx, and Chomsky’s thoughts on this particular issue are all worth analyzing to work
onto a better and more free society.
